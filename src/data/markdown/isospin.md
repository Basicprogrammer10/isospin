Hello, yes this is in fact the website you are looking at currently. This took forever to make so yes it *does* deserve a spot on the projects page . 

If I learned anything from this endeavour, its that I don't want to become a front end web developer. This was kinda fun but god; Designing anything, for me at least, takes forever and it's frustrating and annoying because I can't do it for 6 hours straight without getting diminishing returns. Not a good way to waste your 3 day weekend me, because you just waste half of it trying random stuff that doesn't work.

Anyway I did quite enjoy learning how to setup the backend, using a friend's web server [(afire)](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/afire). It is the only web server library thing I have ever used, but idk seems pretty good. Go check it out and ignore the spelling mistakes :sweat_smile:.

With web development i realise you can just copy and paste some code from the first article you find when you google `Collestt CSS EFFects!!1!one` and slap that on your website to wow people. I didn't want to do that. So tl;dr: this website is made by me. No copy pasting from codepen. Just a bit of copy pasting from stack overflow.
