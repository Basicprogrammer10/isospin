# To-Do list
| Task | Status | Description |
|:---|:-:|:------------|
|Setup Backend|游릭|Suffer(ing)|
|Projects/Home page|游릭|Make the projects page, or the first draft of it at least, so I can show off other stuff I make|
|Bake HTML|游릭|Using iframes is kind of jank to display the parsed markdown, pre-bake the html in the home page (requires some restructuring of the server logic)|
|Spice up Header|游리|Header background is kind of flat. Have some floating squares or circles or something to add some movement / depth|
|Navbar|游리|Figure out how to add a navbar for different sections of the website. Then add it. Maybe with a fancy page transition or something.|
|Writing / Blog|游댯|Add a writing / blog section to the website so my schizophrenic rambling can be immortalized for the whole world to see|
|Image Gallery|游댯|Move floppa stash online|
