<p>Hello, yes this is in fact the website you are looking at currently. This took forever to make so yes it <em>does</em> deserve a spot on the projects page .</p>
<p>Making a website was a fun endeavour, not exactly my cup of tea though; I'm not a designer. I've probably implemented so many of these things super strangely because I'm a lot more comfortable with algorithms and stuff than with web dev n shiz, and this took absolutely <em>f o r e v e r</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway I did quite enjoy learning how to setup the backend, using a friend's web server <a href="https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/afire">(afire)</a>. It is the only web server framework thingy I have ever used, but idk seems pretty good. Go check it out and ignore the spelling mistakes :sweat_smile:.</p>
<p>With web development i realize you can just copy and paste some code from the first article you find when you google <code>Collestt CSS EFFects!!1!one</code> and slap that on your website to wow people. I didn't want to do that. So tl;dr: this website is made by me. No copy pasting from codepen. Just a bit of copy pasting from stack overflow.</p>
<p>Overall I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I'm not too good of a designer but in my humble objectively subjectively correct opinion, it's pretty creative. I have more plans for it and it's still kind of unfinished, but I expect this to be a hub for my projects and thoughts for the forseeable future. Until I get bored and revamp it at least.</p>
